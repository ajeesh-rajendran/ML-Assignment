6.​ Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC Score) 
The assignment has to be performed on BITS Virtual Lab and a (ONE) screenshot 
has to be uploaded as a proof of that. [ 1 mark ] 
Step 3: Prepare Your GitHub Repository 
Your repository must contain: 
project-folder/​
│-- app.py   (or streamlit_app.py)​
│-- requirements.txt​
│-- README.md​
│-- model/ (saved model files for all implemented models - *.py or *.ipynb) 
Step 4: Create requirements.txt 
Example: 
streamlit​
scikit-learn​
numpy​
pandas​
matplotlib​
seaborn 
Missing dependencies are the #1 cause of deployment failure. 
Step 5: README.md with the following structure. This README content should also 
be part of the submitted PDF file. Follow the required structure carefully. 
a.​ Problem statement  
b.​ Dataset description [ 1 mark ] 
c.​ Models used: [ 6 marks - 1 marks for all the metrics for each model ]​
Make a Comparison Table with the evaluation metrics calculated for all the 6  
models as below:  
ML Model Name 
Accuracy 
AUC 
Precision Recall F1 
MCC 
Logistic 
Regression
