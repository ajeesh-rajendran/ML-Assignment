No Resubmission requests will be accepted. 
 
3. Assignment Details 
Step 1: Dataset choice 
Choose ONE classification dataset of your choice from any public repository - 
Kaggle or UCI. It may be a binary classification problem or a multi-class 
classification problem.​
​
Minimum Feature Size: 12​
Minimum Instance Size: 500 
Step 2: Machine Learning Classification models and Evaluation metrics 
Implement the following classification models using the dataset chosen above. All 
the 6 ML models have to be implemented on the same dataset. 
1.​ Logistic Regression 
2.​ Decision Tree Classifier 
3.​ K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier 
4.​ Naive Bayes Classifier - Gaussian or Multinomial 
5.​ Ensemble Model - Random Forest 
6.​ Ensemble Model - XGBoost 
For each of the models above, calculate the following evaluation metrics: 
1.​ Accuracy 
2.​ AUC Score 
3.​ Precision 
4.​ Recall 
5.​ F1 Score
